# Analogy of the Road with a Ditch on either side

For a very long time, I've had a very useful (to me) analogy of life being like a road with a Ditch on either side.
   ![Triangle with ditches](/assets/img/images/20260220_Analogy-of-a-Road-with-a-Ditch-on-Either-Side_triangle-with-ditches.png)]

Almost everything in life (even things that are good) have a point after which they go too far, where they go off the road into "the ditch", or “off the cliff”. For example: There is almost always a political party on the right and one on the left, often arguing against the ditch on the other party's side of the road. To the point where they can both become similar versions of each other, just fighting, each entrenched in their own ditch, against the ditch on the opposite side of the road. When in reality a casual observer could often conclude that the better option lies somewhere between the two ditches (on the road), and if each side had been able to draw a line on the road, just before their own ditch, they could have at least helped each other stay on the road.

I often even say that if you see only one ditch, there is a very good chance that there is one right behind you.

Continuing with this analogy, then we could say that if we manage to stay on the road, we could have a third option, of moving forward towards a goal. And that the process of even moving forward towards a goal, can be like driving towards a point in the horizon, and then having a line on either side of the road could really help us from getting stuck on some unhealthy extreme.

Now some helpful examples: The left usually argues in favor of helping people and not neglecting those who are at the bottom of our society, while the right advocates for individual responsibility. The right might say that the left goes too far into enabling people in their process of helping them, to the point where they become perpetual victims and never end up effectively climbing out of their situation. Where the left might argue that the right created the conditions that led to those people at the bottom or at the very least that they shouldn’t just leave them behind, needing help by only focusing on what was in it for themselves and never realizing the broader consequences of their unregulated decisions. Where the solution may lay somewhere in the middle of those two: it is true that people should be as capable of improving themselves and doing as much as they can empowering those who have the merit to climb, while at the same time recognizing that a portion of their focus would be immensely beneficial if the managed to communicate and collaborate with those on the left that are willing to help them contribute towards solutions, and not simply neglecting those who are in a situation beyond their own ability to help themselves, or even for those who find themselves temporarily in a ditch and help climb out of it. And for those on the Left, to realize that their current condition isn't entirely the fault of others, and that blaming everyone else is often the very thing preventing them from being able to see the solution and gradually empower themselves to find a way back out of their hole, and those on the right often have the resources and the experience that could empower into helping chart a path for even those around them.

In a marriage, there is Mom's side and Dad's side, and they are most productive when they can help each other by complementing their differences and find a way to help keep each other on the road. Acknowledging that both sides can be right up to a certain point, before their point "goes off in the ditch".

Anyways, continuing with the analogy, one might say that from that perspective, we could see how the road could form a virtual triangle towards a goal, and that either side of that triangle represents the lines that should be drawn before the ditch on either side, and that the top vertex in this case would represent the goal, but also, and perhaps more importantly: a marker on the horizon of the limit of what we can see, on our way to our goal. And in the same way we mark a line before the ditch, there are a lot of situations where we need to establish a visible marker on the horizon, where if we haven't reached the goal by then, we can at least pull over, gas up, check our instruments and recalibrate our heading towards the goal. A point beyond which we cannot effectively decide yet, because there are things that escape our perspective. Jesus said that each day has its own set of problems, and that we shouldn't worry past tomorrow, because we aren't there yet. However that doesn't mean we don't have a goal beyond tomorrow, next week, or even the next decade.

That triangle can also represent the mountain we are trying to climb, in which case, the steeper the mountain, then the road has to zig-zag it's way up, but even in that case, there is usually a cliff on one side and a rock wall on the other and a point up ahead where the road bends beyond our current perspective.

However at the same time and finally, one could say that there is a sort of imaginary line behind us, that represents falling out of the bottom of the triangle. Things that we need to do now, that we can't do after a certain point, or things that if we procrastinate or don't do, or decisions that shouldn't be neglected in the moment and that there is a cost for neglecting them. While at the same time, if we are falling behind we can recover if we push forward.

Essentially forming sort of an optimal zone hovering above the bottom of this triangle. A zone that should have a buffer before the lines that mark the side of the triangle. Some wiggle room, kind of like the reaction zone around our car as we drive down the freeway. So that we aren't in such immediate danger of going into the ditch, falling behind, or pushing so hard towards the top vertex to where we are overheating our engine and putting ourselves in danger of the smallest maneuver causing us to crash and rollover.

I find myself using this in pretty much almost every thing I do, decisions I need to make, when I'm advising others... Family, business, church, financial goals, conflict resolution...

Specially conflict resolution:

- If I only see one ditch, it causes me to try to do what I can to acquire awareness of the ditch right behind me.

- Once I've identified both ditches, then try to identify the goal, the point in the horizon I'd like to move forward to, or negotiate orienting the other party to.

- Set a point in the horizon, when do I check back in if I haven't heard back from you...

- Establish the zone "falling behind" on the bottom, “By when would you like me to do this?...”

- What do we need to leave behind, in order to climb to a higher position?

## The Graphic Model

This is meant to be a simple geometric cognitive map, a geometric picture of healthy forward movement under constraint. A triangle of motion, with a circle of optimal positioning inside it.

### 1. The Road and the Ditches

On both sides are ditches.

If we drift too far left or right, even toward something good, eventually there becomes a point after which, that something is no longer good.

- Confidence → arrogance
- Flexibility → compromise of principles
- Discipline → rigidity
- Urgency → recklessness      

The ditches represent excess, unhealthy extremes.
The road represents bounded intention.
So, ideally we should draw lines before the ditch, similar to what happens on an actual road.

### 2. The Horizon Makes It a Triangle

The sides visually converge toward the horizon. When you look ahead down a straight road, it appears to narrow to a point — or at least to a place toward which we are heading. The horizon, or other obstacles, set a limit on what we can see. Yet we often mark a spot on that horizon towards our destination, or at the very least, the next point in our journey.

From that perspective, the road forms a triangle:

- The apex is the visible target.
- The sides are the guardrails drawn before the ditch.
- The narrowing reflects increasing precision required as you approach a goal.

This is not a new structure — it’s simply what a straight path looks like when you look forward.

### 3. The Circular Zone Around You

Where you are standing, there is a conceptual circle.

#### That circle represents:
- The area we occupy, and what we can touch at arms length.
- Our immediate realm of influence.
- Stability zone.

#### You want to remain centered with a buffer.
- Margin
- Present awareness
- Sustainable pacing

#### You don’t want to:
- Hug the left edge.
- Hug the right edge.
- Race so hard toward the horizon that you neglect the ground beneath you.
- Drift so low in effort that you fall behind.

### 4. The Line Behind You

There is also a trailing boundary — the line of falling behind.

Even on a straight road, time moves forward.

There is a reason highways have a minimum speed requirement.

If you slow too much, procrastinate, avoid too long, or hesitate excessively, you aren’t neutral — you’re losing ground. After that line there is a cost, there are usually consequences or at the very least the increased potential of them.

So progress must exceed that trailing line.

It’s a bounded progress model — a geometric picture of healthy parameters with forward movement under constraint.

A hypothetical triangle of perspective, with a circle of optimal positioning zone inside it.

combined:

- Extremes (ditches),
- Objective (horizon point),
- Regression boundary (minimum speed),
- Optional positioning zone (circle)
- With dynamic safety margin around it (buffer),
- And safety side-lines that perspective makes into a triangle with a narrowing tolerance.

Life, decisions, and negotiations are like traveling down a road with a ditch on either side.
